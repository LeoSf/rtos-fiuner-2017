 ** IMPORTANT: some changes have been made to leds.c, switch.c and uart.c in the
 ** driver_bm (v1.0) directory in order to support LEDs physical location in the
 ** first version of the EDU-CIAA board, to get just one word with the
 ** information of keys pressed and to support sending and receiving strings.
