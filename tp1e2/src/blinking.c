/** \brief TP1.2 Bare Metal exercise source file
 **
 ** This is a entry example to implement in another program a RTOS.
 ** Dependencies: baremetal drivers library (v1.0) provided by
 ** MSc. Filomena and MSc. Reta.
 **
 ** Proposed Exercise:
 ** Write a program for the EDU-CIAA-NXP similar to TP1.1 that turns
 ** on for about 3 seconds the yellow led by pressing the button 2.
