/** \brief TP2.1 FreeRTOS exercise source file
 **
 ** This is a entry example to implement in another program a RTOS.
 **
 ** Proposed Exercise:
 ** Design and implement an FreeRTOS-based firmware for EDU-CIAA to turn on the 6 board LEDs,
 ** one at a time and sequentially. The power-on time of each LED should be 250 ms.
 ** A single task and an alarm should be used. The task should be launched at 500 ms
 ** after the OS starts.
 **
 ** Dependencies: baremetal drivers library (v1.0) provided by
 ** MSc. Filomena, MSc. Reta, and Eng. Volentini.
 **
 ** IMPORTANT: some changes have been made to leds.c and switch.c in the driver_bm (v1.0)
 ** directory in order to support LEDs physical location in the first version of the
 ** EDU-CIAA board and to get just one word with the information of keys pressed.
 **
